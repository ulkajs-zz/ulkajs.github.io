cd ulka-site

npm run develop # OR npx ulka develop
```

## Creating production build

```bash
npm run build # OR npx ulka build
```

This command builds all the files into build path specified in `ulka-config.js`

**Serving production build**

```

## Installing ulka globally

You can install ulka globally but it is not recommended as ulka is not completely ready and new versions with betters features will be released in shortly. You would never want to miss those, would you ?. If yes ðŸ˜  please go ahead and run the following command.

```bash
npm i -g ulka
```
